Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. 
They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

# Creational Design Patterns
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

# Structural patterns
These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

# Behavioral patterns
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
