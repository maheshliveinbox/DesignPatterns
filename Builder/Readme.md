Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction 
process can create different representations.

How to Implement
1. Make sure that you can clearly define the common construction steps for building all available product representations. 
Otherwise, you won’t be able to proceed with implementing the pattern.
2. Declare these steps in the base builder interface.
3. Create a concrete builder class for each of the product representations and implement their construction steps.

Don’t forget about implementing a method for fetching the result of the construction. The reason why this method 
can’t be declared inside the builder interface is that various builders may construct products that don’t have a 
common interface. Therefore, you don’t know what would be the return type for such a method. However, if you’re 
dealing with products from a single hierarchy, the fetching method can be safely added to the base interface.
4. Think about creating a director class. It may encapsulate various ways to construct a product using the same builder object.
5. The client code creates both the builder and the director objects. Before construction starts, the client must 
pass a builder object to the director. Usually, the client does this only once, via parameters of the director’s 
constructor. The director uses the builder object in all further construction. There’s an alternative approach, 
where the builder is passed directly to the construction method of the director.
6. The construction result can be obtained directly from the director only if all products follow the same interface. 
Otherwise, the client should fetch the result from the builder.
